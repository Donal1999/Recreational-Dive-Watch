Recreational Dive Watch.

Dónal Ó Maoilchiaráin

Reads temperature, pressure and heartrate. BME280 reads the temperature and pressure. Gravity heartrate sensor calculates beats per minute.
In semester 2 I will add a water pressure sensor that will calculate depth and ascent rate. I will create the website to view all the information gathered by the watch.  
I will have more code written before the presentation on the 17th of December 2024.
